# Data

We published the datasets of web traffic traces produced for the closed world evaluations. They can be downloaded in the releases tab of the [GitHub web interface](https://github.com/wtfpad/wtfpad/releases).

The datasets for the open world and multitab evaluations are also available upon request to the authors.

Please, download the zipped files and unpack them in this directory to be able to run the commands in the main README instructions.
